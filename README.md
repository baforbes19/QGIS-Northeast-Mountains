# QGIS-Northeast-Mountains
Map of Northeast Mountains worth climbing

Mountain Data collected from https://peakbagger.com/

Mountains included are:
  - Mountains on a major 4000 Footer list
  - Any other mountains over 4000 FT with 160 FT of prominence
  - Any Mountain with over 1800 FT of prominence
  - Any accessible Fire/Lookout tower
  - Mountains on the following Peakbagging lists:
      - 52 with a view
      - New Hampshire 3500 Footers
      - Vermont 3500 Footers
      - Maine 3500 Footers
      - Adirondack 29ers
      - Adirondack 29er Junior Peaks
      - Catskill 3500 Footers  
  - Any other peak that might be worth visiting be it due to popularity, views, or any other reason
  
  Note: As better topographic measurements are taken, some mountains previously believed to meet the qualifications of a 4000 Footer do not but are still included on 4000 Footer lists (e.g. Blake Peak). Some mountains previously believed to not meet the qualifications of a 4000 Footer in fact do but are not included on 4000 Footer lists (e.g. Mount Guyot). So as to be inclusive, all of these mountains will be considered 4000 Footers in this collection.
